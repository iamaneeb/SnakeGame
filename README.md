# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Description
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow larger. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as possible without crashing.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Random generation of food pellets for replayability.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
